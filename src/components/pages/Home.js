          Hi, my name is Jing Li.  I am currently starting my career in Software Engineering. 
          I've been studying and working as an accountant in the past few years in Portland, Oregon.
          During my accounting job, I had an opportunity to access to some data processing related work.  
          So I taught myself some simple data processing using SQL, and Python.
          In the process of learning python, I developed a strong curiosity about computer languages.
          After learning Python, Java, and data structures from Udemy and Coursera for a while, I decided 
          to systematically learn computer-related knowledge through GeorgiaTech Bootcamp since I'm going 
          to move to Atlanta this year. Hopefully, I can get admission to the 2022 Fall Online Master Program after I finished the BootCamp.
      </p>  
      <p>
        Combing my accounting experience and software engineering knowledge, my career goal is to work in a financial software company 
        like Intuit to develop tax preparation applications like Turbo Tax or accounting programs like Quickbook as a software developer.
      </p>

        When I'm not working, I enjoy cooking for my families and friends, and experiencing different recipes. 
          I am really good at cooking North Asian style food, especially Chinese food. Recently, I tried some Spanish cuisine recipe, like paella, and Gazpacho. 
          Besides that, Zumba is my other hobby. Hope after the pandemic, I can go back to dance studio to hang out with my friends.
